Simple barn door tracker. Working on Arduino Nano or one of its clones. 
Uses an M6 threaded bar 274mm from the hinge
Stepper motor is an inexpensive BYJ48 which you can get anywhere

the #define OUT 1-5 show which pins to connect on the arduino and stepper board

Works fine off a power bank. Tap the motor power off the RAW pin of the arduino.

Can't remember where the stepper code came from but it was GPL so paying that license forward.
